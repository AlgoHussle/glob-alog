# Two Forms of Pre-Rendering

Next.js has two forms of pre-rendering: **Static Generation** and **Server-side Rendering**. The difference is in **when** it generates the HTML for a page.

- **Static Generation** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at **build time**. The pre-rendered HTML is then _reused_ on each request.

- **Server-side Rendering** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on **each request**.
